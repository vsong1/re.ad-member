                <p>
                    On Tuesday evening, I decided to make
                    <a href="#" onclick="toggleTooltip('widget-1')">dinner</a>
                    because the
                    <a href="#"
                        onclick="openTab(document.querySelector('#tabs .tab:nth-child(2)'), 'site-1'); this.textContent='migraine'; addText('widget-3')"
                        id="widget-2">headache</a>
                    I'd had all afternoon finally faded enough to make the idea of chopping vegetables seem
                    manageable.
                    <span id="widget-3" style="display: none;">I still wasn't sure what caused my headache, although
                        WebMD suggested
                        it might be the excessive amount of caffeine that I consume, which seems plausible. I would
                        blame that on
                        Joyce though; if I did not have to cover for her every day, I wouldn't need to drink so much
                        coffee.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I stood in front of the refrigerator with the door open longer than necessary, letting the cold air
                    drift
                    out over my feet. Inside, things looked as they usually do: a half-used bag of baby carrots slouched
                    sideways on the second
                    shelf<span class="forget-text" data-click="6">, a carton of eggs <span id="widget-8">from two weeks
                            ago</span>,</span>
                    and a package of chicken thighs that, according to the printed label, needed to be cooked by the
                    following day.
                    There was also a bunch of green onions
                    <span class="forget-text" data-click="5">lying diagonally across the top shelf</span>, and an
                    assortment of bottled and jarred condiments in the door,
                    some nearly empty
                    (soy sauce<a href="#" onclick="toggleTooltip('widget-4'); addText('widget-5'); removeText(this)">,
                        ketchup</a><span class="forget-text" data-click="3">, pesto</span>)
                    and other barely touched
                    (ranch<a href="#" id="widget-5" onclick="toggleTooltip('widget-4')" style="display: none;">,
                        ketchup</a><span class="forget-text" data-click="3">, Tabasco</span>,
                    some fancy chili paste that I was gifted last Christmas).
                    I tapped the chicken package lightly with my finger: that would be enough of a direction for the
                    night.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <a href="#"
                        onclick="openTab(document.querySelector('#tabs .tab:nth-child(3)'), 'site-2'); toggleTooltip('widget-7'); toggleHide('widget-8'); trackClicks(this)"
                        id="widget-6">pan</a>
                    I use for most dinners was already out on the stove because I had washed it the night before
                    and left it on the still-warm burner to dry. I adjusted its position and turned the dial just enough
                    to make the ignition
                    click softly—one, two, three times—before the flame appeared in that small blue half-ring that
                    always looks
                    slightly weaker than I expect it to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The chicken thighs felt heavier than I remembered when I lifted them from the package. I trimmed a
                    small strip of fat
                    with scissors because the idea of taking out the cutting board felt like too much of an escalation
                    for a Tuesday. The
                    scissors stuck slightly with each snip, and I briefly wondered how many times I had trimmed things
                    with them
                    <a href="#"
                        onclick="openTab(document.querySelector('#tabs .tab:nth-child(7)'), 'site-6'); changeText9(); addText('widget-12'); trackClicks(this)">without

                </p>

                <p>
                    When the oil in the pan began to shimmer
                    subtly, I laid the chicken pieces in one by one. They made a weak sizzling sound, almost a squeal, 
                    <span id="widget-13" onclick="toggleHide('widget-13')">like the chicken was not fully committed to being cooked yet.</span> 
                    I pressed the pieces downward with the back of a fork to encourage
                    contact with the pan, an action that always makes me feel strangely 
                    <a href="#" onclick="changeText13(); toggleHide('widget-13'); openTab(document.querySelector('#tabs .tab:nth-child(10)'), 'site-9'); trackClicks(this)">authoritative</a> 
                    even though it achieves very little. A faint smell of raw poultry and heating oil rose up, 
                    the predictable prelude to something edible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While the chicken browned, I turned back to the refrigerator to find something to accompany it. The
                    baby carrots
                    seemed like the easiest choice. They were slightly dried at the ends, with that pale, chalky look
                    they get after
                    sitting too long in the cold. I poured a handful into my palm—too many! I put two back-and set them
                    beside the stove. I debated slicing them but concluded their current shape was acceptable. Dinner,
                    on nights like
                    this, is more about assembling heat and ingredients than creating any coherent dish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I flipped the chicken over. The cooked side looked patchy, with a golden section near the center and
                    a paler
                    one near the edge. I pretended not to care about the unevenness, though I did feel a brief impulse
                    to press down
                    again with the fork. Instead, I added the carrots by simply scattering them around the chicken in a
                    loose semicircle,
                    like arranging props for a low-budget photograph. They rolled into place and made a small clattering
                    sound against
                    the pan, then settled into a steady, muted hiss.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The green onions came next. I grabbed them without rinsing and sliced them with
                    my <span id="widget-12">salmonella-free </span>scissors directly over the pan. The pieces fell in
                    floppy green rings,
                    some landing neatly, others bouncing off
                    the chicken and falling onto the stove. One piece landed near the burner grate, and I watched it
                    curl slightly as if
                    startled. I brushed it back into the pan with the handle of the fork and felt disproportionately
                    accomplished.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As everything cooked, a thin fog of steam rose and condensed on the microwave door above the stove.
                    I always notice
                    this because the moisture dries unevenly, leaving streaks that I never quite manage to clean. The
                    sound of the pan
                    shifted from a sharp sizzle to a more diffuse bubbling, which told me—without needing to look—that
                    the chicken had
                    begun releasing its own moisture. The carrots, meanwhile, were softening in an uneven, haphazard
                    way, some touching
                    the hottest parts of the pan, others drifting toward cooler spots as if trying to avoid
                    responsibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the chicken looked finished, I turned off the burner and let everything sit in the pan for a
                    minute, before
                    spooning the chicken and vegetables into a slightly too small bowl. One carrot rolled out and onto
                    the counter. I placed it back on top with the sense of restoring order, even though it made no
                    difference to the meal.
                    I ate at the table without adding sauce or seasoning beyond the initial salt: partly out of
                    laziness, partly because
                    none of the sauces in the fridge seemed worth opening for a meal this unambitious.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span id="widget-19"><a href="#" onclick=" flash(); removeText(document.getElementById('widget-19')); addText('widget-20')">I remember the taste of the food clearly.</a> 
                    It tasted exactly like what it was: chicken, carrots, green onion, 
                    pan heat. Nothing surprising, nothing disappointing. But paradoxically, there's often something memorable about 
                    the mundane, about the little things that slip through the cracks when you aren't paying attention. When I was 
                    finished, I rinsed the bowl, washed the fork, and wiped the counter. The pan stayed on the stove to dry, exactly 
                    as it had the night before.</span>
                </p>

                    that can’t be right. I didn’t cook chicken. I remember boiling pasta. Or sitting on the couch, waiting for

                    chapter in some trashy novel I read or a doomscrolling session at midnight, where all the details blur into some 
                    vague idea or theme.</a>

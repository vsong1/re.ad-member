                <p>
                    On Tuesday evening, I decided to make 
                    <a href="#" onclick="toggleTooltip('widget-1')">dinner</a> 
                    because the

                    I'd had all afternoon finally faded enough to make the idea of chopping vegetables seem 
                    manageable.
                    <span id="widget-3" style="display: none;">I still wasn't sure what caused my headache, although WebMD suggested 
                    it might be the excessive amount of caffeine that I consume, which seems plausible. I would blame that on
                    Joyce though; if I did not have to cover for her every day, I wouldn't need to drink so much coffee.</span>  
                </p>
                
                <p>    
                    I stood in front of the refrigerator with the door open longer than necessary, letting the cold air drift 
                    out over my feet. Inside, things looked as they usually do: a half-used bag of baby carrots slouched sideways on the second 
                    shelf<span class="forget-text" data-click="3">, a carton of eggs <span class="forget-text" data-click="1">from two weeks ago</span>,</span> 
                    and a package of chicken thighs that, according to the printed label, needed to be cooked by the following day.
                    There was also a bunch of green onions
                    <span class="forget-text" data-click="2">lying diagonally across the top shelf</span>, and an assortment of bottled and jarred condiments in the door, 
                    some nearly empty 
                    (soy sauce<a href="#" onclick="toggleTooltip('widget-4'); addText('widget-5'); removeText(this)">, ketchup</a><span class="forget-text" data-click="2">, pesto</span>) 
                    and other barely touched 
                    (ranch<a href="#" id="widget-5" onclick="toggleTooltip('widget-4')" style="display: none;">, ketchup</a><span class="forget-text" data-click="3">, Tabasco</span>, 
                    some fancy chili paste that I was gifted last Christmas). 
                    I tapped the chicken package lightly with my finger: that would be enough of a direction for the night.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The <a href="#" onclick="openTab(document.querySelector('#tabs .tab:nth-child(3)'), 'site-2'); toggleTooltip('widget-7'); trackClicks(this)" id="widget-6">pan</a> 
                    I use for most dinners was already out on the stove because I had washed it the night before 
                    and left it on the still-warm burner to dry. I adjusted its position and turned the dial just enough to make the ignition 
                    click softly—one, two, three times—before the flame appeared in that small blue half-ring that always looks 
                    slightly weaker than I expect it to. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The chicken thighs felt heavier than I remembered when I lifted them from the package. I trimmed a small 
                    strip of fat with scissors because the idea of taking out the cutting board felt like too much of an escalation 
                    for a Tuesday. The scissors stuck slightly with each snip, and I briefly wondered how many times I had trimmed 
                    things with them without washing them properly, but not enough to stop me. I salted the chicken with the 
                    same shaking motion I always use, a motion that never distributes the salt evenly and never bothers me 
                    enough to correct it.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When the oil in the pan began to shimmer subtly, I laid the chicken pieces in one by one. They made the familiar 
                    sizzling sound, though tentatively, like the chicken was not fully committed to being cooked yet. I pressed the 
                    pieces downward with the back of a fork to encourage 
                    contact with the pan, an action that always makes me feel strangely authoritative even though it achieves very 
                    little. A faint smell of raw poultry and heating oil rose up, the predictable prelude to something edible.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    While the chicken browned, I turned back to the refrigerator to find something to accompany it. The baby carrots 
                    seemed like the easiest choice. They were slightly dried at the ends, with that pale, chalky look they get after 
                    sitting too long in the cold. I poured a handful into my palm—too many! I put two back-and set them 
                    beside the stove. I debated slicing them but concluded their current shape was acceptable. Dinner, on nights like 
                    this, is more about assembling heat and ingredients than creating any coherent dish.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I flipped the chicken over. The cooked side looked patchy, with a golden section near the center and a paler 
                    one near the edge. I pretended not to care about the unevenness, though I did feel a brief impulse to press down 
                    again with the fork. Instead, I added the carrots by simply scattering them around the chicken in a loose semicircle, 
                    like arranging props for a low-budget photograph. They rolled into place and made a small clattering sound against 
                    the pan, then settled into a steady, muted hiss.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The green onions came next. I grabbed them without rinsing—an act of mild culinary rebellion—and sliced them with 
                    the scissors directly over the pan. The pieces fell in floppy green rings, some landing neatly, others bouncing off 
                    the chicken and falling onto the stove. One piece landed near the burner grate, and I watched it curl slightly as if 
                    startled. I brushed it back into the pan with the handle of the fork and felt disproportionately accomplished.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As everything cooked, a thin fog of steam rose and condensed on the microwave door above the stove. I always notice 
                    this because the moisture dries unevenly, leaving streaks that I never quite manage to clean. The sound of the pan 
                    shifted from a sharp sizzle to a more diffuse bubbling, which told me—without needing to look—that the chicken had 
                    begun releasing its own moisture. The carrots, meanwhile, were softening in an uneven, haphazard way, some touching 
                    the hottest parts of the pan, others drifting toward cooler spots as if trying to avoid responsibility.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When the chicken looked finished—firm, lightly browned, giving off that faint, familiar sheen—I turned off the burner 
                    and let everything sit in the pan for a minute. I don’t know when I adopted the habit of letting food rest in the pan, 
                    but doing so always feels faintly professional, even when the meal itself looks like something improvised by someone 
                    halfway through moving apartments.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I spooned the chicken and vegetables into a bowl. The bowl was slightly too small, so one carrot rolled out and onto 
                    the counter. I placed it back on top with the sense of restoring order, even though it made no difference to the meal. 
                    I ate at the table without adding sauce or seasoning beyond the initial salt—partly out of laziness, partly because 
                    none of the sauces in the fridge seemed worth opening for a meal this unambitious.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The food tasted exactly like what it was: chicken, carrots, green onion, pan heat. Nothing surprising, nothing 
                    disappointing. It filled the space of the evening just enough to feel like dinner had occurred, without imposing any 
                    larger meaning. When I was finished, I rinsed the bowl, washed the fork, and wiped the counter. The pan stayed on the 
                    stove to dry, exactly as it had the night before.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And that was dinner.
                </p>
